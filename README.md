# Credentials Storing Assistant

Problem Statement : With this fast moving world where everything is online, we create accounts for everything like social account, financial account, ineuron account etc. Remembering credentials for each and every account is very hard. Create an assistant program or C program which will store all your credentials at one place and according to the requirement only you can access it.

Features :
1. Try to build authentication logic
2. Mask the password with '*'
3. It should be menu driven for good user interactability.
